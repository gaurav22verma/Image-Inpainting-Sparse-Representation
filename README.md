# Steps:

1. Run the `SparseInpainting.py` using `python SparseInpainting.py`
 * The parameters (like dictionary size, patch size etc.) can be changed from this file itself. Refer to line #8 to line # 14.
 * Don't forget to change line #73, #75, #76, and #113 if you want to run the algorithm on different files (the default is Daniel Radcliff).
 * Comment/uncomment line #183 and #184 to run OMP or IRLS

2. Run `computeNIQE.py` using `python computeNIQE.py` to get the NIQE value
 * Please change the filename in line #5

3. `Report.pdf` is the report for the assignment.
